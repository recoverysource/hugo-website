strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and
help others to recover from alcoholism.</p><p>The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no
dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting through our own
contributions. A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics,
organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither
endorses nor opposes any causes.</p><p>Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.</p><p><sub>Reprinted with permission of The A.A. Grapevine, Inc.</sub></p><h2 id=the-twelve-questions>The Twelve Questions</h2><blockquote><p>If sobriety were easy, everyone would do it.</p></blockquote><p>Only you can decide whether you want to give Alcoholics Anonymous a try&ndash;whether
you think it can help you.</p><p>We who are in A.A. came because we finally gave up trying to control our drinking.
We still hated to admit that we could never drink safely. Then we heard from other
A.A. members that we were sick. (We thought so for years!) We found out that many
people suffered from the same feelings of guilt and loneliness and hopelessness
that we did. We found out that we had these feelings because we had the disease
of alcoholism. We decided to try to face up to what alcohol had done to us.</p><p>World Services provides a <a href=https://www.aa.org/self-assessment>Twelve Question</a>
Self Assessment that can help you decide if A.A. and/or sobriety might be right
for you. We tried to contemplate these questions and answer them honestly.</p><h2 id=the-twelve-steps>The Twelve Steps</h2><p>A.A.&rsquo;s Twelve Steps are a group of principles, spiritual in their nature, which,
if practiced as a way of life, can expel the obsession to drink and enable the
sufferer to become happily and usefully whole.</p><p>World Services maintains a copy of <a href=https://www.aa.org/the-twelve-steps>The Twelve Steps</a>.</p><h2 id=the-twelve-traditions>The Twelve Traditions</h2><p>A.A.&rsquo;s Twelve Traditions apply to the life of the Fellowship itself. They outline
the means by which A.A. maintains its unity and relates itself to the world about
it&ndash;the way it lives and grows.</p><p>World Services maintains a copy of <a href=https://www.aa.org/the-twelve-traditions>The Twelve Traditions</a>.</p><h2 id=the-twelve-concepts>The Twelve Concepts</h2><blockquote><p>I Am Responsible. When anyone, anywhere, reaches out for help, I want the hand
of AA always to be there. For that: I Am Responsible.</p></blockquote><p>The Twelve Concepts for World Service were written by A.A.&rsquo;s co-founder Bill W.,
and were adopted by the General Service Conference of Alcoholics Anonymous in 1962.
The Concepts are an interpretation of A.A.&rsquo;s world service structure as it emerged
through A.A.&rsquo;s early history and experience.</p><p>World Services maintains a copy of <a href=https://www.aa.org/the-twelve-concepts>The Twelve Concepts</a>.</p><h2 id=the-big-book>The Big Book</h2><p>The first 164 pages of <a href=https://www.aa.org/bigbookonline/>The Big Book</a> are
the nuts and bolts of our program. They provide directions to get sober. It
explains the principles we need to live by in order to stay sober.</p><p>The stories following the first 164 are a combination of old and new stories of
other men and women who suffered from alcoholism but have found sobriety.</p><p>Additionally, Grapevine maintains a collection of <a href="https://www.aagrapevine.org/archive?f%5B0%5D=topics%3A634">Personal Stories</a>
submitted by other A.A.&rsquo;s.</p></div></main></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-resources widget"><h4 class="widget-resources widget__title">Resources</h4><div class="widget-resources widget__item"><b>24-Hour Help: </b><span class=content><a href=tel:123-456-7890>123-456-7890</a></span></div><div class="widget-resources__item widget__item"><a class="widget-social__link widget__link btn" style=display:inline title="Meeting Schedule" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=/meeting-schedule.pdf><span>Meeting Schedule</span></a></div><div class="widget-resources__item widget__item"><a class="widget-social__link widget__link btn" style=display:inline title="Big Book Online" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://www.aa.org/bigbookonline/><span>Big Book Online</span></a></div></div><div class="widget-social widget"><h4 class="widget-social__title widget__title"></h4><div class="widget-social__item widget__item"><a class="widget-social__link widget__link btn" title="A.A.
